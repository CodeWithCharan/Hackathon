# Hackathon - Building a Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project was developed during a hackathon, where the goal was to analyze movie ratings from the MovieLens dataset and augment it with IMDb ratings by scraping IMDb pages. The objective was to identify and analyze the most popular and highly-rated movies based on various criteria, such as genre, user ratings, and IMDb ratings.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/). This dataset contains 100,000+ ratings and 3,600+ tag applications across 9,700+ movies. It includes the following files:

- `movies.csv`: Contains movie information (movieId, title, genres).
- `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp).
- `links.csv`: Provides links to corresponding IMDb and TMDb pages (movieId, imdbId, tmdbId).
- `tags.csv`: Contains user-generated tags for movies.

## Challenges

- **Scraping Issues**: Encountered difficulties with changes in IMDb's HTML structure, which required manual inspection and updates to the scraping script.
